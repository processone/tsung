Description: A distributed multi-protocol load testing tool.
 Tsung is a distributed load testing tool.
 It is protocol-independent and can currently be used to stress and
 benchmark HTTP, Jabber/XMPP, LDAP, MySQL and PostgreSQL servers.
 It simulates user behaviour using an XML description file, reports
 many measurements in real time (statistics can be customized with
 transactions, and graphics generated using gnuplot).
 For HTTP, it supports 1.0 and 1.1, has a proxy mode to record
 sessions, supports GET and POST methods, Cookies, and Basic
 WWW-authentication. It also has support for SSL.
